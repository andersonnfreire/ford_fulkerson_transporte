# Sistema de transporte de cargas

A transport company has several transport vehicles with different loading requirements and needs
know how to allocate your vehicles to transport a cargo flow from a source to a destination among its various
distribution centers. 

The company has a cargo control system that generates the necessary flow between the centers
distribution in a csv file and a txt file containing a list of available vehicles with their capacity.
The system also provides distances between each distribution center in another CSV.

Knowing that for each flow the company needs to allocate a vehicle that has a greater load capacity
next flow, thus being necessary for the following features:


 - Which vehicles will be allocated for each flow and the path that must be taken by the vehicle;
 - For each flow, determine the distance that each vehicle must travel;
 - Inform the list of unallocated vehicles.
 - If there are not enough vehicles available, send a message informing the user;
 - Inform how much cargo was pending in each center;
 - Check if there is a path in which only one edge is null. (Inform which edge and path).
